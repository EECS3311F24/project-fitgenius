## Motivation

FitGenius is an application meant to ease users into their fitness journey conveniently.

We all know starting to work out can be very daunting and difficult especially to those with no guidance.

Health is an essential part of everyone's life and should not be neglected.

The aim with FitGenius is to get everyone working out through the use of our app.

## Contribution

In order for multiple group members to develop the application effectively, we work according to tickets created on Trello.

After a member picks up a ticket, they will create a new branch. The naming convention is just descriptive, concise, and using kebab case.

The member will also make a pull request for other members to view, requiring one approval for the PR to be merged.
