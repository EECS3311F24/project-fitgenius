# Sprint 2 Restrospective Meeting

## Participants
- Sheraz Saeed
- Brandon Ngo
- Sam Lee
- Davit Piruzyan
- Ayaan Mohammed

## Unfinished Tasks
We still need to add a functionality for users to delete saved plans from the database.

## Practices to Continue
We should continue to create and peer review PRs so every team member sees the changes before they are merged.

## New Practices to Consider
Maybe we should start using a linter for our code to provide consistent formatting throughout the application.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
Sometimes there would be merge conflicts because of people working in the same area.

## Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 2
Best Experience: A great experience was getting used to working together as a team, and therefore being able to work together more effectively.

Worst Experience: The worst experience during sprint 2 was troubleshooting why MongoDB wouldn't connect for some team members, and it was all because of the small fact their IPs weren't whitelisted.
