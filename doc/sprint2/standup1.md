## Ayaan Mohammed

### 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
- Since the last standup, I worked on reviewing the rubric to understand the deliverables and ensuring the work was divided effectively. I coordinated with Sam, who was organizing the tasks on Trello, and we discussed the task prioritization. Additionally, I explored how to create radio buttons for implementing the intensity level feature, ensuring they aligned with the design requirements.
  
### 2. What do you commit to next?
- I commit to starting the implementation of the radio buttons that allow users to select the intensity level (Low, Medium, High). I will ensure the selected value is stored in local storage using appropriate variables for faster access and retrieval.
  
### 3. When do you think you'll be done?
- I expect to be done in the next few days, as soon as I complete learning how to effectively use local storage.

### 4. Do you have any blockers?
- So far, the main blocker is that I don't yet know how to work with local storage, which is preventing me from getting started with implementing the functionality.
