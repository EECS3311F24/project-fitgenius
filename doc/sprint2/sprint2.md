- **Brandon Ngo**
- **Sam Lee**

## Sprint Goal
The goal of this sprint is to enhance user experience by enabling workout customization, improving workout adaptability, and refining the user interface. We aim to implement a feature that allows users to personalize their workout sessions, including options to adjust reps and cooldowns according to workout intensity. This customization will make the workouts more effective and tailored to individual needs. Additionally, we will address existing CSS issues, refining the look and feel of the interface to create a smoother, more visually appealing experience. By the end of the sprint, users should experience a more intuitive, flexible, and attractive workout interface.

Timebox: 3 days

To Do: Make individual schedules so that everyone is on the same page and also deliver other course deliverables on time as well.
