Our team came together through Discord, either by inviting friends directly or connecting through friends of friends. We used Discord as our primary communication tool, making decisions by discussing topics through messages or calls, both on the platform and outside of class. Initially, we met once a week to brainstorm and settle on a project topic. As the project progresses, we anticipate increasing the frequency of our meetings, whether in person or on Discord, depending on everyone’s availability. Looking ahead, it's crucial that we plan carefully to ensure timely completion of the project, especially since we expect everyone to become busier toward the end of November. This means setting clear goals and coordinating well to manage our schedules effectively.

Our team was formed through a combination of Discord and personal connections, with many members joining by inviting friends or friends of friends. Discord quickly became our main tool for communication and collaboration. We used it not only for real-time discussions but also for text-based conversations outside of our regular meetings. Decision-making was often an informal process, typically involving discussions either on Discord or face-to-face when we met outside of class. This flexible approach allowed us to weigh everyone’s input efficiently, whether we were working through details of the project or addressing broader concerns.

We organized our meetings to occur once a week, focusing on the initial brainstorming phase and selecting a project topic. During these sessions, everyone contributed ideas, and we collectively discussed the feasibility and interest levels surrounding each one. We didn't employ formal tools like task boards or project management software, but we naturally prioritized tasks based on the immediate needs of the project and what seemed most achievable at the time. User stories or tasks were not assigned numerical points, as we took a more intuitive approach to determining workload. Instead of formal voting rounds for deciding on the point estimates, decisions were made by gauging consensus through conversation. We relied on discussions to align our priorities and find common ground, which made it easy to adjust tasks based on everyone’s availability.

As the project moved forward, we recognized the need for more frequent and structured meetings. While our initial weekly sessions were enough to define the scope of the project, we anticipate meeting more often to ensure smooth progress. Whether it’s meeting in person or setting up additional times on Discord when everyone is free, our flexibility will be key to maintaining momentum. Since we know that workloads will increase as the semester progresses, especially around the end of November, we must be proactive in planning. By setting clear milestones and coordinating our schedules well in advance, we can avoid last-minute rushes and ensure we deliver a high-quality project.

Looking ahead to future phases, there are several lessons we’ll carry with us. First, planning will be crucial; we need to establish concrete deadlines and milestones to ensure steady progress throughout the project timeline. Additionally, communication remains a vital component, and we should continue to rely on Discord not just for casual chats, but for more structured planning as well. As we anticipate schedules getting busier toward the end of the semester, we’ll need to be more mindful of time management and individual availability. Setting realistic expectations for everyone’s contributions will be key to avoiding burnout and maintaining team cohesion. By staying organized, communicative, and proactive, we’re confident we can navigate these challenges successfully.
