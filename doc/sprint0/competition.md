One of the main competitors that we designed our product around is Google Fit (https://www.google.com/fit/). Generally speaking they offer similar fitness tracking at a basic level.

However, our product will cater to your specific needs whether you are just beginning your fitness journey or are an avid exerciser by giving you a selection of fine tuned home-based workouts that you will be able to customize their order of exercises. Google has a vast library of exercises and outdoor activities that may be overwhelming to a newcomer and some of them require expensive gym equipment. Our app will also incorporate GIFs to demonstrate correct posture and form for the intended exercise 

Google also has a network of devices through which they can track biometrics and merge them into this app but we are not catering to biometric tracking and we do not have the scope (in this project) to establish wearable device integration. Hence, our data entries are made directly by the user. 

Our targeted users are defined by the following user stories:
As a beginner, I want to watch GIF animations of exercises so that I can ensure I am using the correct form and avoid injury.

As a retired individual, in my old-age, I want to access beginner-friendly workout routines so that I can improve my fitness and stamina to play actively with my grandchildren.

As a busy professional, I want personalized, short workout routines so that I can incorporate exercise into my hectic schedule and engage in fitness discussions with my colleagues.

Also the following scenarios:
Scenario 1: A beginner user is learning how to exercise correctly using the appâ€™s GIF animations to ensure proper form and prevent injuries during workouts.

Scenario 2: A retired user starts a fitness journey with beginner exercises recommended by the app, aiming to improve his health and be more active with his grandchildren.

Scenario 3: A busy professional integrates short workouts into her day with the app's personalized routines, allowing her to improve fitness and join conversations about health with her colleagues.
