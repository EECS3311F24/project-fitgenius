Project Objectives for FitGenius Mobile Fitness Application
1. Key Objectives: The objective of the FitGenius mobile fitness application is to introduce users to
weightlifting and effective workout routines by providing personalized guidance and real-time progress
tracking. The application aims to simulate the experience of having a personal trainer without the
associated scheduling and cost challenges. The platform offers customization, flexibility, and accessibility
for users to confidently start their fitness journeys, from home.

2. Key Users:

• Beginners: Users with little or no experience in fitness training, seeking guidance to confidently
start their fitness journey.

• Intermediate Users: Individuals with some experience in fitness training who want
personalized workouts and tracking to improve their fitness routines.

• Busy Professionals: Individuals with time constraints who need quick and effective workout
routines that fit their schedules.

• Home Exercisers: Users who prefer to work out at home due to personal preferences or
financial limitations and need guided, at-home workout routines.

3. Key Use Cases:

• Use Case 1: Exercise Recommendations: The app provides tailored exercise
recommendations based on the user’s fitness goals and muscle groups they want to target. Users
can receive daily or weekly workout suggestions.

• Use Case 2: Custom Workout Routines: Users can build and save custom workout routines
by selecting from a library of exercises. They can adjust the number of sets, reps, and weights to
match their progress.

• Use Case 3: Progress Tracking: The app tracks user progress, including repetitions, sets, and
time spent exercising, and offers visual feedback to motivate users. It provides analytics on their
performance and improvement over time.

• Use Case 4: Fitness Reminders: To ensure consistency, the app sends reminders to users
about their upcoming workouts, helping them stay on track.

• Use Case 5: Demonstration GIFs: For each exercise, the app provides GIFs demonstrating
proper form and technique, ensuring that users perform exercises safely and effectively.

4. Key Usage Scenarios:

• Scenario 1: Personalized At-Home Workout: A user who is new to weightlifting wants to
start training at home. They use FitGenius to receive beginner-level recommendations for a fullbody
workout. The app guides them through the workout with demonstration GIFs and suggests
rest intervals using the cooldown timer.

• Scenario 2: Busy Professional with Limited Time: A busy professional has only 20
minutes for a workout. They input their time constraint, and the app suggests a short, highintensity
workout that fits their schedule.

• Scenario 3: Progress Motivation and Goal Setting: A user sets a fitness goal to increase
their bench press weight over three months. The app tracks their progress each session and
provides motivating feedback when milestones are achieved.

Audience This document is intended for instructors and TAs to gain a clear understanding of the scope
and objectives of the FitGenius application. It will also serve the team as a reference point during the
development phases to prioritize work and ensure that project goals align with user needs and project
constraints.

By adhering to these objectives, the FitGenius project aims to empower users at all fitness levels to embark
on a guided, customized, and motivating fitness journey.

Key Principles for FitGenius
For the current iteration of the FitGenius design, the team has chosen to focus on two key principles:

1. Personalization Over Uniformity: The design prioritizes tailoring the fitness experience to each
individual user's needs, preferences, and goals, even if it means adding complexity to the backend system.
Whether a user is a beginner or an experienced fitness enthusiast, they should feel that the app is custombuilt
for their unique journey. Features like customized workout plans, dietary recommendations, and goal
setting are personalized based on user input, and the app continually adjusts to user feedback and
performance. The guiding principle is to ensure every user feels like they are receiving personal trainerlevel
care and guidance.

2. User Motivation Over Feature Density: Instead of focusing on loading the app with a plethora
of features, the design aims to concentrate on elements that keep users motivated and engaged. This
means that core features like progress tracking, achievement milestones, and motivational messages are
polished and seamlessly integrated. The design ensures that users stay inspired and committed to their
fitness routines by providing constant feedback and encouragement. Simplifying the user experience helps
remove distractions and puts the focus on meaningful, motivating interactions.

These principles, like those in earlier research, came from the team’s understanding of users’ frustrations
and their desire to create great user experiences. The team has a set of principles they rotate focus on with
each design iteration, ensuring that every aspect of the app evolves in line with user needs and
preferences.
