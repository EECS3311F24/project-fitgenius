# Sprint 3 Restrospective Meeting

## Participants
- Sheraz Saeed
- Brandon Ngo
- Sam Lee
- Davit Piruzyan
- Ayaan Mohammed

## Unfinished Tasks
We still need to add a functionality for to put feedback comments. We also need to add guidance for exercises.

## Practices to Continue
We should continue to communicate our current tasks and when we completed something as before.

## New Practices to Consider
Maybe we should implement a CI/CD pipeline.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
Less often than before but still sometimes there would be merge conflicts because of people working in the same area.

## Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 2
Best Experience: A great experience was frontend and backend members of the team being able to work together with minimal blockers.

Worst Experience: The worst experience during sprint 3 was coordinating meetings because it is the end of the semester and everyone is busy.
