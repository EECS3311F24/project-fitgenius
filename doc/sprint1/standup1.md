# Oct 25th 2024 - Sprint 1 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
The team focused on getting familiar with Git and React.js. This included basic workflows, setting up repositories, and experimenting with React components to build foundational knowledge for the project.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
The next commitment is to resolve initial difficulties with setting up remote branches and to increase comfort with version control. Team members aim to ensure everyone is confident in using Git collaboratively for effective project management.

## 3. When do you think you'll be done?
All members agreed they would need at least two more days to become comfortable with the setup and address any remaining questions about version control and workflow in Git and React.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
Some group members are still in the middle of midterm exams, which has led to prioritization challenges. These members need a few more days to balance their academic obligations with the project work.
