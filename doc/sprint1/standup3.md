# Oct 31st 2024 - Sprint 1 Standup 3

## 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
Everyone focused on their assigned tasks and worked to complete them to the best of their abilities, making progress on the main page, recommendations, exercise buttons, GIF demonstrations, and the cooldown timer.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
- Sam has completed his development tasks and is moving on to the writing tasks for the project documentation.
- Other team members will push their code as soon as possible and then proceed with the writing tasks.
- Once all code is successfully pushed, the team will record the project demo.

## 3. When do you think you'll be done?
- The goal is to finish a day before the deadline to allow for any necessary last-minute changes.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
A key challenge has been accurately estimating the time needed for each task. As a result, the timeline is tight, with most tasks scheduled to wrap up in the last few days before the deadline.
