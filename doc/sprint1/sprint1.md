# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting Document

## Participants:

- **Sheraz Saeed**
- **Brandon Ngo**
- **Sam Lee**
- **Davit Piruzyan**
- **Ayaan Mohammed**

## Sprint Goal
The goal of this sprint is to establish the foundational components of our app, beginning with the homepage/title page. We aim to implement the recommended page, which will display four primary muscle groups (legs, chest, arms, back) with each section containing a list of exercises. Upon clicking an exercise, a GIF showing the proper exercise form will be displayed. Additionally, a cooldown timer feature will be implemented, allowing users to set their desired duration for recovery.

## Team Capacity
Total Capacity: 10 workdays x ~3 hours per person = 30 hours

## Spikes
**1. Familiarity with Git and React**

Context: Some team members are not fully familiar with the basics of Git and React.

Timebox: 3 days

To Do: Allocate time for members to get familiar with Git and React, focusing on basic workflows and app structure.

**2. Muscle Groups and Exercise Selection**

Context: We need to define the major muscle groups to be covered and the exercises within each group.

Timebox: 1 day

To Do: Discuss and finalize which muscle groups to focus on and how specific each exercise should be for optimal user experience.

## User Stories to be Worked On
User story numbers are referenced from PB.md

**User Story 1**
Description: As a user, I want to receive personalized exercise recommendations, so that I can follow a workout routine tailored to my needs.

Tasks Breakdown:
1) Recommended Navigation Bar: Set up a navigation bar that routes users to the recommended page, displaying images for each muscle group (legs, chest, arms, back).
2) Hover Effect on Navigation Bar: Implement a hover effect that increases the size of the navigation bar and changes its color to green.
3) Exercise Image Click-through: Ensure each muscle group image is clickable and directs users to the corresponding exercise page.

**User Story 5**
Description: As a user, I want to view demonstration GIFs for each exercise so that I can perform the movements with correct form.

Tasks Breakdown:
1) GIF Collection: Gather relevant exercise demonstration GIFs.
2) Link Buttons for GIFs Page: Ensure that buttons correctly link to the page where GIFs are displayed.
Exercise List Navigation: Clicking on an exercise in the list should direct users to the GIF demonstration page.

**User Story 6**
Description: As a user, I want to have a cooldown timer after my workouts to ensure proper recovery between sets.

Tasks Breakdown:
1) Design Timer Button: Create a button for starting the cooldown timer.
2) Timer Functionality: Implement the timer feature with start, stop, and reset functionality to accommodate different user needs.

## Summary
The team will focus on setting up the core navigation and functionality for the homepage and recommended page, establishing clickable sections for muscle groups with exercise demonstrations. The cooldown timer functionality will be added to support post-workout recovery. By the end of this sprint, we aim to have these basic components and interactions functional, with a clear structure for continued development.
