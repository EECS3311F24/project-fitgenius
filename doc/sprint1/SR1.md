## Unfinished Tasks
We were unable to finalize the design of the UI and clarify how the elements should look.

## Practices to Continue
Frequent conversations and regular updates on everyone’s workload were very beneficial for keeping everyone aligned and informed. This practice provided greater transparency and improved collaboration.

## New Practices to Consider
Better Time Management: Allocating dedicated time slots for certain tasks may help us meet our deadlines more reliably and reduce uncertainty.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
Sometimes, team members wouldn’t communicate when their tasks would be completed, which led to misalignment and delayed dependencies. Moving forward, we’ll aim to improve communication around task completion timelines.

## Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 1
Best Experience: Learning new technologies and applying them was both motivating and rewarding, as it allowed us to broaden our skill set and showcase our work.

Worst Experience: The constant uncertainty about whether our product met quality standards was stressful and impacted our confidence in the project.
